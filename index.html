  <h2 class="placevalue">His Contribution to the Astronomy</></h2>
  </h3>
  <div id="img2-caption">
    <h3 class="value">The astronomical calculations and deductions suggested by Aryabhatta are extraordinary by the fact that he didnâ€™t have any modern equipment or instrument to do it. He had a very sharp brain and his dedication and hard work led him to solve the various<br>
      mysteries of the solar system.<p> He also deduced that the earth is round in shape and rotates along its own axis, which forms the existence of day and night. Many superstitious beliefs were challenged by him and he presented scientific reasons to
      prove them wrong.</p></h3>

  <h2 class="placevalue1">His role in the place value system</h2>
  <div id="img-caption">
    <h3 class="value">
      He also played a very major role in determining the place value system and discovering the zero. He also worked on the summation series of square roots and cube roots. He is also regarded as the first to use zero in the place value system.
      <br>
        He also calculated the sidereal rotation, which is the rotation of the earth in relation to the fixed stars. His theories and deductions formed the base of the trigonometry and algebra.</h3>

    <h2 class="placevalue">Tributes</h2>
    <h3 class="value">Bihar has nurtured knowledge for thousand of years. The works of many scientific thinkers like Aryabhata, Panini, Varahamihira, Bhaskara, Brahamagupta and Vashist Narayan Singh can be traced to the land of Bihar.<br> Aryabhata (476-550 CE) was first in line of mathematician- astronomers from the classical age of Indian Mathematics and Indian Astronomy.<p> His major work, Aryabhatiya- a compendium of Mathematics and Astronomy was of great influence on several neighboring cultures through transitions.
      Aryabhata asserted that moon, planets and asterisms shine by reflected sunlight.</p> He also correctly explained the causes of eclipses of the sun and the moon.</h3>
